course_description: >-
  The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost fifty years because
  it lets people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes
  called "the duct tape of programming", it helps users combine existing
  programs in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters
  and clouds that may be halfway around the world. This lesson will introduce
  its key elements and show you how to use them efficiently.

          What is the relationship between the graphical file explorer that most
          people use and the shell?

          - The file explorer lets you view and edit files, while the shell lets
          you run programs.

          - The file explorer is built on top of the shell.

          - The shell is part of the operating system, while the file explorer
          is separate.

          - They are both interfaces for issuing commands to the operating
          system.

          The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively,
          i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in
          alphabetical order at each level. The command `ls -t` lists things by
          time of last change, with most recently changed files or directories
          first. In what order does `ls -R -t` display things?


          1. All files and then all directories in order of last change.

          2. All directories in alphabetical order followed by all files in
          order of last change.

          3. Directories alphabetically by level, and their contents in order of
          last change.

          You want to remove duplicate lines from multiple files with one
          command, so you write `uniq births.txt mortality.txt`. What actually
          happens?


          1. The command removes any duplicate lines that occur in either
          `births.txt` or `mortality.txt`.

          2. The command removes duplicate lines in `births.txt` and
          `mortality.txt` independently.

          3. The command removes duplicate lines in `births.txt` and
          `mortality.txt`, *and* removes the first line(s) of `second.txt` if
          they duplicate the last line(s) of `births.txt`.

          4. The command removes duplicate lines from `births.txt` and stores
          the result in `mortality.txt`.

          Given your answer to the previous question, what happens if you run

          1. It removes duplicate lines from `births.txt` and stores the result
          in `births.txt`.

          2. It erases the contents of `births.txt`.

          3. It produces no output, because every line of input now appears to
          be duplicated.

        title: Sorting Multiple Files

          1. It sorts the contents of `births.txt` and then the contents of
          `mortality.txt` separately.

          2. It sorts the merged contents of `births.txt` and `mortality.txt` as
          if they were one file.

          3. It sorts `births.txt` and writes the output to `mortality.txt`
          (overwriting whatever was there).

          4. None of the above.

          documentation (or type `man tail` into your favorite search engine)
          and then write a single command that displays the last line of
          `birth.txt` and `mortality.txt` *without* filename headers.
