  History lets you repeat things with just a few keystrokes,
  and pipes let you combine existing commands to create new ones.
  In this chapter, you will see how to go one step further
  and create new commands of your own.

## How can I edit a file?

Unix has a bewildering variety of text editors.
For this course,
we will use a simple one called Nano.
If you type `nano filename`,
it will open `filename` for editing
(or create it if it doesn't already exist).
You can move around with the arrow keys,
delete characters using backspace,
and do other operations with control-key combinations:

- Ctrl-K: delete a line.
- Ctrl-U: un-delete a line.
- Ctrl-O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output').
- Ctrl-X: exit the editor.

*** =instructions

Run `nano names.txt` to edit a new file in your home directory
and enter the following four lines:

```
Lovelace
Hopper
Johnson
Wilson
```

To save what you have written,
type Ctrl-O to write the file out,
then Enter to confirm the filename,
then Ctrl-X and Enter to exit the editor.

Note: if you view our solution,
it uses `cp` instead of `nano` for our automated back end to check,
because the back end can't edit files interactively.

*** =solution
```{shell}
# Run "nano names.txt" instead of the following command: 
cp /solutions/names.txt .
```

*** =sct
```{python}
from shellwhat_ext import test_compare_file_to_file
Ex() >> test_compare_file_to_file('names.txt', '/solutions/names.txt')
```

## How can I record what I just did?

When you are doing a complex analysis,
you will often want to keep a record of the commands you used.
You can do this with the tools you have already seen:

1. Run `history`.
2. Pipe its output to `tail -n 10` (or however many recent steps you want to save).
3. Redirect that to a file called something like `figure-5.history`.

This is better than writing things down in a lab notebook
because it is guaranteed not to miss any steps.
It also illustrates the central idea of the shell:
simple tools that produce and consume lines of text
can be combined in a wide variety of ways
to solve a broad range of problems.

## How can I save commands to re-run later?

You have been using the shell interactively so far.
But since the commands you type in are just text,
you can store them in files for the shell to run over and over again.
To start exploring this powerful capability,
put the following command in a file called `headers.sh`:

```{shell}
head -n 1 seasonal/*.csv
```

This command selects the first row from each of the CSV files in the `seasonal` directory.
Once you have created this file,
you can run it by typing:

```{shell}
bash headers.sh
```

This tells the shell (which is just a program called `bash`)
to run the commands contained in the file `headers.sh`,
which produces the same output as running the commands directly.

```{python}
```

*** =type1: ConsoleExercise

*** =hint1

Put the commands shown into the file without extra blank lines or spaces.

## How can I re-use pipes?

A file full of shell commands is called a *shell script*,
or sometimes just a "script" for short.
Scripts don't have to have names ending in `.sh`,
but this lesson will use that convention
to help you keep track of which files are scripts.

Scripts may contain pipes.
For example,
if `all-dates.sh` contains this line:

```{shell}
cut -d , -f 1 seasonal/*.csv | grep -v Date | sort | uniq
```

then:

```{shell}
bash all-dates.sh > dates.out
```

will extract the unique dates from the seasonal data files
and save them in `dates.out`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
import shutil
shutil.copyfile('/solutions/teeth-start.sh', 'teeth.sh')
```

*** =sample_code1
```{shell}

                     redirect='teeth.out',
                     last_line=True,
                     msg='Run the script with `bash` and use `>` to redirect its output.') \

## How can I pass filenames to scripts?

A script that processes specific files is useful as a record of what you did,
but one that allows you to process any files you want is more useful.
To support this,
you can use the special expression `$@` (dollar sign immediately followed by at-sign)
to mean "all of the command-line parameters given to the script".
For example,
if `unique-lines.sh` contains this:

```{shell}
sort $@ | uniq
```

then when you run:

```{shell}
bash unique-lines.sh seasonal/summer.csv
```

the shell replaces `$@` with `seasonal/summer.csv` and processes one file.
If you run this:

```{shell}
bash unique-lines.sh seasonal/*.csv
```

it processes all four data files,
and so on.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
import shutil
shutil.copyfile('/solutions/count-records-start.sh', 'count-records.sh')
```

*** =type1: ConsoleExercise
*** =key1: 7a893623af

*** =xp1: 10

*** =instructions1

Edit the script `count-records.sh` and fill in the `____` placeholders
so that it counts the number of lines in one or more files,
excluding the first line of each.

Use `nano count-records.sh` to edit the filename.

*** =sample_code1
```{shell}
```

*** =solution1
```{shell}
# Run "nano count-records.sh" instead of the following command: 
cp /solutions/count-records.sh .
```

--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:bash xp:50 key:4092cb4cda
## How can I process a single argument?

As well as `$@`,
the shell lets you use `$1`, `$2`, and so on to refer to specific command-line parameters.
You can use this to write commands that feel simpler or more natural than the shell's.
For example,
you can create a script called `column.sh` that selects a single column from a CSV file
when the user provides the filename as the first parameter and the column as the second:

```{shell}
cut -d , -f $2 $1
```

and then run it using:

```{shell}
bash column.sh seasonal/autumn.csv 1
```

Notice how the script uses the two parameters in reverse order.

<hr>

The script `get-field.sh` is supposed to take a filename, 
the number of the row to select, 
the number of the column to select,
and print just that field from a CSV file.
For example:

```
bash get-field.sh seasonal/summer.csv 4 2
```

should select the second field from line 4 of `seasonal/summer.csv`.
Which of the following commands should be put in `get-field.sh` to do that?

*** =possible_answers
- `head -n $1 $2 | tail -n 1 | cut -d , -f $3`
- [`head -n $2 $1 | tail -n 1 | cut -d , -f $3`]
- `head -n $3 $1 | tail -n 1 | cut -d , -f $2`
- `head -n $2 $3 | tail -n 1 | cut -d , -f $1`

*** =hint

Remember that command-line parameters are numbered left to right.

*** =feedbacks
- No: that will try to use the filename as the number of lines to select with `head`.
- Correct!
- No: that will try to use the column number as the line number and vice versa.
- No: that will use the field number as the filename and vice versa.

## How can one shell script do many things?

Our shells scripts so far have had a single command or pipe,
but a script can contain many lines of commands.
For example,
you can create one that tells you how many records are in the shortest and longest of your data files,
i.e.,
the range of your datasets' lengths.

Use Nano to edit the script `range.sh`
and replace the `____` placeholders so that it lists
the names and number of lines in all of the files given on the command line
*without* showing the total number of lines in all files.
(Do not try to subtract the column header lines from the files.)

*** =hint1

Use `wc -l $@` to count lines in all the files given on the command line.

*** =sample_code1

## How can I write loops in a shell script?

Shell scripts can also contain loops.
You can write these loops using semi-colons,
or split them across multiple lines to make them more readable:

```{shell}
# Print the first and last data records of each file.
for filename in $@
do
    head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
    tail -n 1 $filename
done
```

(You don't have to indent the commands inside the loop,
but it makes things clearer.)

The first line of this script is a **comment**
to tell readers what the script does.
Comments start with the `#` character and run to the end of the line.
Your future self will thank you for adding brief explanations like the one shown here
to every script you write.

## What happens when I don't provide filenames?

A common mistake in shell scripts (and interactive commands) is to put filenames in the wrong place.
If you type:

```{shell}
tail -n 3 somefile.txt
```

then `tail` prints the last three lines of the file.
If, on the other hand, you type:

```{shell}
head -n 5 somefile.txt | tail -n 3
```

then since `tail` hasn't been given the names of any files to process,
it waits for some other program (in this case, `head`) to send it data.

<hr>

What happens if you run the command:

```{shell}
head -n 5 | tail -n 3 somefile.txt
```

*** =instructions
- It prints lines 3-5 of `somefile.txt` and halts.

a3 = 'Correct: `tail` prints the last 3 lines of the file, but `head` then waits forever for input.'
Ex() >> test_mc(3, [a1, a2, a3])
