title       : Creating new tools

  History lets you repeat things with just a few keystrokes,
  and pipes let you combine existing commands to create new ones.
  In this chapter, you will see how to go one step further
  and create new commands of your own.

## How can I edit a file?

Unix has a bewildering variety of text editors,
some of which combine the power of tools like RStudio or the Jupyter Notebook
with the readability of Egyptian hieroglyphics.
For this course,
we will use a very simple editor called Nano.
If you type `nano filename`,
it will open `filename` for editing
(or create it if it doesn't already exist).
You can then move around with the arrow keys,
delete characters with the backspace key,
and so on.
You can also do a few other operations with control-key combinations:

- Ctrl-K: delete a line.
- Ctrl-U: un-delete a line.
- Ctrl-O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output').
- Ctrl-X: exit the editor.

*** =instructions

Run `nano names.txt` to edit a new file in your home directory
and enter the following four lines:

```
Lovelace
Hopper
Johnson
Wilson
```

To save what you have written,
type Ctrl-O to write the file out,
then Enter to confirm the filename,
then Ctrl-X and Enter to exit the editor.

*** =solution
```{shell}
cp /solutions/names.txt .
```

*** =sct
```{python}
from shellwhat_ext import test_compare_file_to_file
Ex() >> test_compare_file_to_file('names.txt', '/solutions/names.txt')
```

## How can I record what I just did?

When you are doing a complex analysis,
you will often want to keep a record of the commands you used.
You can do this with the tools you have already seen:

1. Run `history`.
2. Pipe its output to `tail -n 10` (or however many recent steps you want to save).
3. Redirect that to a file called something like `figure-5.history`.

This is better than writing things down in a lab notebook
because it is guaranteed not to miss any steps.
It also illustrates the central idea of the shell:
simple tools that produce and consume lines of text
can be combined in a wide variety of ways
to solve a broad range of problems.

## How can I save commands to re-run later?

You have been using the shell interactively so far.
But since the commands you type in are just text,
you can store them in files for the shell to run over and over again.
To start exploring this powerful capability,
put the following command in a file called `headers.sh`:

```{shell}
head -n 1 seasonal/*.csv
```

This command selects the first row from each of the CSV files in the `seasonal` directory.
Once you have created this file,
you can run it by typing:

```{shell}
bash headers.sh
```

This tells the shell (which is just a program called `bash`)
to run the commands contained in the file `headers.sh`,
which produces the same output as running the commands directly.

## How can I re-use pipes?

A file full of shell commands is called a *shell script*,
or sometimes just a "script" for short.
Scripts don't have to have names ending in `.sh`,
but this lesson will use that convention
to help you keep track of which files are scripts.

Scripts may contain pipes.
For example,
if `all-dates.sh` contains this line:

```{shell}
cut -d , -f 1 seasonal/*.csv | grep -v Date | sort | uniq
```

then:

```{shell}
bash all-dates.sh > dates.out
```

will extract the unique dates from the seasonal data files
and save them in `dates.out`.

## How can I pass filenames to scripts?

A script that processes specific files is useful as a record of what you did,
but one that allows you to process any files you want is more useful.
To support this,
you can use the special expression `$@` (dollar sign immediately followed by ampersand)
to mean "all of the command-line parameters given to the script".
For example,
if `unique-lines.sh` contains this:

```{shell}
sort $@ | uniq
```

then when you run:

```{shell}
bash unique-lines.sh seasonal/summer.csv
```

the shell replaces `$@` with `seasonal/summer.csv` and processes one file.
If you run this:

```{shell}
bash unique-lines.sh seasonal/*.csv
```

it processes all four data files,
and so on.

--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:bash xp:50 key:4092cb4cda
## How can I process a single argument?

As well as `$@`,
the shell lets you use `$1`, `$2`, and so on to refer to specific command-line parameters.
You can use this to write commands that feel simpler or more natural than the shell's.
For example,
you can create a script called `column.sh` that selects a single column from a CSV file
when the user provides the filename as the first parameter and the column as the second:

```{shell}
cut -d , -f $2 $1
```

and then run it using:

```{shell}
bash column.sh seasonal/autumn.csv 1
```

Notice how the script uses the two parameters in reverse order.

<hr>

The script `get-lines.sh` is supposed to take
a start line,
and an end line as arguments,
and select that range of lines from that file.
For example:

```
bash get-lines.sh seasonal/summer.csv 5 8
```

should select lines 5-8 from `seasonal/summer.csv`.
Which of the following commands should be put in `get-lines.sh` to do that?

*** =possible_answers
- `head -n $1 $2 | tail -n $3`
- `head -n $2 $1 | tail -n $3`
- `head -n $3 $2 | tail -n $1`
- [`head -n $3 $1 | tail -n $2`]

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- No: that will try to use the filename as the number of lines to select with `head`.
- No: that will try to use the end line number as the filename.
- No: that one uses the starting line number as the filename.
- Correct!

## How can one shell script do many things?

Our shells scripts so far have had a single command or pipe,
but a script can contain many lines of commands.
For example,
you can create one that tells you how many records are in the shortest and longest of your data files,
i.e.,
the range of your datasets' lengths.

## How can I write loops in a shell script?

Shell scripts can contain loops as well as pipes and multiple command lines.
You can write these loops using semi-colons,
or to make them more readable,
you can split them across multiple lines like this:

```{shell}
# Print the first and last data records of each file.
for filename in $@
do
    head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
    tail -n 1 $filename
done
```

You don't have to indent the commands inside the loop,
but it make scripts more readable.

The first line of this script is a **comment**
to tell readers what the script does.
Comments start with the `#` character and run to the end of the line.
Your future self will thank you for adding brief explanations like the one shown here
to every script you write.

## What happens when I don't provide filenames?

A common mistake in shell scripts (and interactive commands) is to put filenames in the wrong place.
If you type:

```{shell}
tail -n 3 somefile.txt
```

then `tail` prints the last three lines of the file.
If, on the other hand, you type:

```{shell}
head -n 5 somefile.txt | tail -n 3
```

then since `tail` hasn't been given the names of any files to process,
it waits for some other program (in this case, `head`) to send it data.

<hr>

```{shell}
head -n 5 | tail -n 3 somefile.txt
```
