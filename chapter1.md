title       : Manipulating files and directories
description : >-
  This chapter is a brief introduction to the Unix shell.  You'll learn
  why it is still in use after almost fifty years, how it compares to the
  graphical tools you may be more familiar with, how to move around in the
  shell, and how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.

## How does the shell compare to a graphical user interface?

An operating system like Windows, Linux, or Mac OS is a special kind of program.
It controls the computer's processor, hard drive, and network connection,
but its most important job is to run other programs.

Since human beings aren't digital,
they need an interface to interact with the operating system.
The most common one these days is a graphical file explorer,
which translates clicks and double-clicks into commands to open files and run programs.
Before computers had graphical displays,
though,
people typed instructions into a program called a **command-line shell**.
Each time a command is entered,
the shell runs some other programs,
prints their output in human-readable form,
and then displays a *prompt* to signal that it's ready to accept the next command.
(Its name comes from the notion that it's the "outer shell" of the computer.)

Typing commands instead of clicking and dragging may seem clumsy at first,
but as you will see,
once you start spelling out what you want the computer to do,
you can combine old commands to create new ones
and automate repetitive operations
with just a few keystrokes.

<hr>
What is the relationship between the graphical file explorer that most people use and the command-line shell?

*** =possible_answers
- The file explorer lets you view and edit files, while the shell lets you run programs.
- The file explorer is built on top of the shell.
- The shell is part of the operating system, while the file explorer is separate.
- [They are both interfaces for issuing commands to the operating system.]

*** =hint
Remember that a user can only interact with an operating system through a program.

*** =feedbacks
- Both allow you to view and edit files and run programs.
- Graphical file explorers and the shell both call the same underlying operating system functions.
- The shell and the file explorer are both programs that translate user commands (typed or clicked) into calls to the operating system.
- Correct! Both take the user's commands (whether typed or clicked) and send them to the operating system.

## Where am I?

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **filesystem**.
It organizes data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called "folders"),
which hold files or other directories.

Every file or directory is identified by an **absolute path**
that specifies how to get to it from the top (or **root**) of the filesystem.
For example,
the path `/home/repl` is the path to a directory called `repl` inside a directory called `home`,
while the path `/home/repl/course.txt` identifies a file called `course.txt` inside that directory.

To find out where you are in the filesystem,
type the command `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory").
This tells you the absolute path of your **current working directory**,
which is where the shell will run commands and look for files
unless and until you tell it to do so elsewhere.
You can also use the command `whoami` to find out who the computer thinks you are.

<hr>
Run `pwd` in the shell window to the right.
Where are you right now?

*** =instructions
- `/home`
- `/repl`
- `/home/repl`

*** =hint
Unix systems typically place all users' home directories underneath `/home`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =sct
```{python}
err = "That is not the correct path."
correct = "Correct - you are in `/home/repl`."

Ex() >> test_mc(3, [err, err, correct])
```

--- type:MultipleChoiceExercise lang:shell xp:50 skills:1 key:f5b0499835
## How can I identify files and directories?

`pwd` tells you where you are,
but doesn't tell you what files and directories are there.
To find out,
you can use the command `ls` (which is short for "listing").
Entered on its own,
it lists the contents of your current working directory
(the one displayed by `pwd`).
If you add the names of one or more files,
`ls` will list those files,
and if you add the names of directories,
it will list the contents of those directories.
For example,
`ls /home/repl` will show you the contents of your starting directory
(usually called your **home directory**),
which is the same as what it shows you if you are in that directory and type `ls` on its own.

<hr>
Use `ls` with an appropriate argument to get a listing of the files in the directory `/home/repl/seasonal`
(which holds information on dental surgeries by date, broken down by season).
Which of the following files is *not* in that directory?

*** =instructions
- `autumn.csv`
- `fall.csv`
- `spring.csv`
- `winter.csv`

*** =hint
If you give `ls` a path, it shows what's in that path.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =sct
```{python}
err = "That file is in the `seasonal` directory."
correct = "Correct - that file is *not* in the `seasonal` directory."

Ex() >> test_mc(2, [err, correct, err, err])
```

--- type:BulletConsoleExercise key:a766184b59
## How else can I identify files and directories?

An absolute path is like the latitude and longitude of a point on a map:
it specifies the same thing no matter where you are.
A **relative path**,
on the other hand,
specifies a location starting from where you are:
it's like saying "20 kilometers north".

For example,
if you are in the directory `/home/repl`,
the relative path `seasonal` specifies the same directory as `/home/repl/seasonal`,
and the relative path `seasonal/winter.csv` specifies the same file as `/home/repl/seasonal/winter.csv`.
The shell can tell whether a path is absolute or relative by looking at its first character.
If the path begins with `/`, it is absolute;
if it doesn't,
it is relative.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =instructions1

You are in `/home/repl`.
Use `ls` with a relative path
to list the file `/home/repl/course.txt` (and only that file).

*** =hint1

You can often construct the relative path to a file or directory below your current location
by subtracting the absolute path of your current location
from the absolute path of the thing you want.

```

--- type:BulletConsoleExercise key:dbdaec5610
## How can I move to another directory?

Just as you can move around in a file browser by double-clicking on folders,
you can move around in the filesystem using the command `cd`
(which stands for "change directory").

If you type `cd seasonal` and then type `pwd`,
the shell will tell you that you are now in `/home/repl/seasonal`.
If you then run `ls` on its own,
it shows you the contents of `/home/repl/seasonal`,
because that's where you are.
If you want to get back to your home directory `/home/repl`,
you can use the command `cd /home/repl`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =type1: ConsoleExercise

```

--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:shell xp:50 skills:1 key:09c717ef76
## How can I move up a directory?

The **parent** of a directory is the directory above it.
For example, `/home` is the parent of `/home/repl`,
and `/home/repl` is the parent of `/home/repl/seasonal`.
You can always give the absolute path of your parent directory to commands like `cd` and `ls`.
More often,
though,
you will take advantage of the fact that the special path `..`
(two dots with no spaces) means "the directory above the one I'm currently in.
If you are in `/home/repl/seasonal`,
then `cd ..` moves you up to `/home/repl`.
If you use `cd ..` once again,
it puts you in `/home`.
One more `cd ..` puts you in the *root directory* `/`,
which is the very top of the filesystem.

A single dot on its own, `.`, always means "the current directory",
so `ls` on its own and `ls .` do the same thing,
while `cd .` has no effect
(because it moves you into the directory you're currently in).

One final special path is `~`
(the tilde character, pronounced *til-duh*),
which means "your home directory".
No matter where you are,
`ls ~` will always list the contents of your home directory,
and `cd ~` will always take you home.

<hr>
If you are in `/home/repl/seasonal`,
where does `cd ~/../.` take you?

*** =possible_answers
- `/home/repl`
- [`/home`]
- `/home/repl/seasonal`

*** =hint
Trace the path one directory at a time.

*** =feedbacks
- No, but either `~` or `..` on its own would take you there.
- Correct - the path means 'home directory', 'up a level', 'here'.
- No, but `.` on its own would do that.

Ex() >> test_mc(2, [err1, correct, err3])

## How can I copy files?

Once you have some files,
you will often want to make copies,
move them into other directories in order to organize them,
or rename them.
One command to do this is `cp`, which is short for "copy".
If `original.txt` is an existing file,
then the command:

```{shell}
cp original.txt duplicate.txt
```

creates a copy of `original.txt` called `duplicate.txt`.
If there already was a file called `duplicate.txt`,
it is overwritten.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
```

*** =type1: ConsoleExercise
*** =key1: 6ab3fb1e25

*** =xp1: 10

*** =instructions1

Make a copy of `seasonal/summer.csv` in the `backup` directory,
calling the new file `summer.bck`.

*** =hint1

Combine the name of the destination directory and the name of the copied file
to create a relative path for the new file.

*** =sample_code1
```{shell}
```

*** =solution1
```{shell}
cp seasonal/summer.csv backup/summer.bck
```

*** =sct1
```{python}
from shellwhat_ext import test_cmdline
Ex() >> test_cmdline([['cp', '', ['seasonal/summer.csv', 'backup/summer.bck']]],
                     msg='Provide two paths to `cp`.')
```

*** =type2: ConsoleExercise
*** =key2: d9e1214bb0

*** =xp2: 10

*** =instructions2

If the last parameter to `cp` is an existing directory,
then a command like:

```{shell}
cp seasonal/autumn.csv seasonal/winter.csv backup
```

copies *all* of those files into that directory.
Use this fact
to copy the spring and summer data files (located in the `seasonal` directory) into the `backup` directory
*without* changing directory
(i.e., run a single command from your home directory).

*** =hint2

Use `cp` with the names of the files you want to copy
and *then* the name of the directory to copy them to.

*** =sample_code2
```{shell}
```

*** =solution2
```{shell}
cp seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv backup
```

*** =sct2
```{python}
import re
from shellwhat_ext import test_cmdline
msg = 'Provide two filenames and a directory name to `cp`.'
Ex() >> test_or(test_cmdline([['cp', '', ['seasonal/spring.csv', 'seasonal/summer.csv', re.compile(r'backup/?')]]], msg=msg),
                test_cmdline([['cp', '', ['seasonal/summer.csv', 'seasonal/spring.csv', re.compile(r'backup/?')]]], msg=msg))
```

--- type:ConsoleExercise lang:shell xp:100 skills:1 key:663a083a3c
## How can I move a file?

While `cp` gives you a way to copy a file,
`mv` lets you move it from one directory to another,
just as if you had dragged it in a graphical file browser.
It handles its parameters the same way as `cp`,
so the command:

```{shell}
mv autumn.csv winter.csv ..
```

moves the files `autumn.csv` and `winter.csv` from the current working directory
up one level to its parent directory
(because `..` always refers to the directory above your current location).

*** =instructions

Using a single command,
move the spring and summer data files to the `backup` directory.

*** =solution
```{shell}
mv seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv backup
```

*** =sct
```{python}
import re
from shellwhat_ext import test_cmdline
msg = 'Use two filenames and a directory name as parameters.'
Ex() >> test_or(test_cmdline([['mv', '', ['seasonal/spring.csv', 'seasonal/summer.csv', re.compile(r'backup/?')]]], msg=msg),
                test_cmdline([['mv', '', ['seasonal/summer.csv', 'seasonal/spring.csv', re.compile(r'backup/?')]]], msg=msg))
```

--- type:BulletConsoleExercise key:001801a652
## How can I rename files?

`mv` can also be used to rename files.
If you run:

```{shell}
mv course.txt old-course.txt
```

then the file `course.txt` in the current working directory is "moved" to the file `old-course.txt`.
This is different from the way file browsers work,
but is often handy.

One warning:
just like `cp`,
`mv` will overwrite existing files.
If,
for example,
you already have a file called `old-course.txt`,
then the command shown above will replace it with whatever is in `course.txt`.

## How can I delete files?

We can create files,
copy them,
and move them around;
the only thing left is to delete them.
The command to do this is `rm`,
which stands for "remove".
As with `cp` and `mv`,
you can give `rm` the names of as many files as you'd like.

```{shell}
rm thesis.txt backup/thesis-2017-08.txt
```

removes both `thesis.txt` and `backup/thesis-2017-08.txt`

`rm` does exactly what its name says,
and it does it right away:
unlike graphical file browsers,
the shell doesn't have a trash can,
so when you type the command above,
your thesis is gone for good.

## How can I create and delete directories?

`mv` treats directories the same way it treats files:
if you are in your home directory and run `mv seasonal by-season`,
for example,
`mv` changes the name of the `seasonal` directory to `by-season`.
However,
`rm` works differently.

If you try to `rm` a directory,
the shell will print an error message telling you that it can't do that,
primarily to stop you from accidentally deleting an entire directory full of work.
Instead,
you must use a separate command called `rmdir`.
For added safety,
it only works when the directory is empty,
so you must delete all the files in a directory *before* you delete the directory.

## Wrapping up

you can put them in `/tmp`,
which is where programs typically keep files that they only need briefly.
