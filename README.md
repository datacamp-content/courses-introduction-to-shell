## Description

*The course description is an opportunity for you to "sell" your course to students! Why is this an important topic? What are some interesting applications? What will they be able to do after taking your course? Here's an example from another course:*

At the end of day, the value of Data Scientists rests on their ability to describe the world and to make predictions. Integral to both of these processes is building models and this course will focus on the fundamental models used in classical machine learning: supervised learning models. You'll come out of this course with practical knowledge of how to implement them on real world data using scikit-learn, the industry standard machine learning library for Python.

## Learning objectives

*The learning objectives should be specific and action-oriented. What are the key takeaways from your course? Here are some examples:*

* Learn basic supervised learning algorithms to solve regression and classification problems.
* Learn about measures of model performance (e.g. accuracy, AUC).
* Be able to test the predictive power of your models using test-train split and k-fold cross validation.
* Be able to improve the performance of your models using preprocessing, regularization, and feature selection.
