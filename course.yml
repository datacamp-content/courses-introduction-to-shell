title: Introduction to Shell for Data Science
description: The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost fifty years
  because it lets people do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes
  called "the universal glue of programming", it helps users combine existing programs
  in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and clouds
  that may be halfway around the world. This course will introduce its key elements
  and show you how to use them efficiently.
