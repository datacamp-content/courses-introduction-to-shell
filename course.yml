description: The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost fifty years
  because it lets people do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes called
  "the universal glue of programming", it helps users combine existing programs in
  new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and clouds that
  may be halfway around the world. This course will introduce its key elements and
  show you how to use them efficiently.
