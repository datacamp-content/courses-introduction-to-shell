title: Introduction to Shell
description: >-
  The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost 50 years because it
  lets people do complex things with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes called
  "the universal glue of programming," it helps users combine existing programs
  in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and
  clouds that may be halfway around the world. This course will introduce its
  key elements and show you how to use them efficiently.
